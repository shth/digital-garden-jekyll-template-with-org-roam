use [[id:66967ca0-3b0a-4fdb-8267-920795719519][DNS Server]] to return the IP address of the origin server

could assign multiple IP address to single domain

Then rotate the address to balance the load

Cons:
- The client might cache the [[id:5b72ae0c-fa7b-4f02-afeb-0f75f046477b][DNS Lookup]] result, which breaks the rotation
