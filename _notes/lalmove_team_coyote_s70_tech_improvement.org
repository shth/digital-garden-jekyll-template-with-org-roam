* improve performance for running all tests in local machine
* add build task in MR CI pipeline
make sure all merged commits are deployable to master
* replace momentJS?
* improve browser cache invalidation of pre env
now it is using the release version in path
e.g. https://web.pre.lalamove.com/locales/en-HK/translation.json?version=3.94.1

which will not be updated when deploying to pre.

This cause the browser to cache stale files e.g. translation files

could append commit hash to make sure it is invalidated everytime
* remove exhaustive deps eslint rule
change it to warn, we are disabling it in many places

also avoid
useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(...)
}, [dispatch])

look [[https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920#issuecomment-471070149][here]] for what it protect against
