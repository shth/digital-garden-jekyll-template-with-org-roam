table `[[id:fad8dae5-bd6d-43f9-9103-6245ee02fe36][Lalamove t_unpaid_order table]]`

when the order become paid, it needs to be removed from the table
this leads to the query code to loop for 5 times, when a record is found, it needs to check whether the order is paid or not.
if yes, then it is deleted from `t_unpaid_order` table and then the loop continue
if no, the record is returned as unpaid order
