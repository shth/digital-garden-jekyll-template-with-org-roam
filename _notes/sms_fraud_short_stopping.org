what to do to prevent this kind of attack:
- use 2FA to verify the account
- prevent international calling if possible
- rate limiting
- form validations
  - to prevent numbers to expensive routes
- use exponential delays between retries
- look up numbers to check the linetype
- monitor OTP conversion rate
