* Packet loss
will decrease the capacity of the connection

[[id:20a4359e-7cb9-4028-9b9b-610759322ff6][HTTP2]] might be more affected than [[id:b10ceeb9-aad3-47f5-894d-33ad1a23d74b][HTTP]] because it only use 1 connection, a single packet loss can affect the entire connection
* [[id:8f171f0c-1c33-41b5-8e50-55a9ffc5eabb][Head of line blocking]]
