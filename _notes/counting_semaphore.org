a buffered channel which act as counters for how many goroutines can run at a time

the reversed action (sending = acquire, receiving = release) is to avoid having to fill the channel upfront

a [[id:bc46fa6a-1cba-424b-b3e0-73304aadf2fa][Go Mutex]] is just a counting semaphore with capacity of 1
#+begin_src go
sema := make(chan struct{}, 20)

func() {
  sema <- struct{}{}  // acquire token
  // ...
  <-sema              // release token
}
#+end_src
