* Interface value

when a variable is initialized as an interface type, it becomes interface value

it has following structure
- type descriptor

 the current run time type after variable assignment

  e.g.
 #+begin_src go
var x io.Writer

x = os.Stdout
 #+end_src
 x's type descriptor will be *os.File(os.Stdout's type)
- value
 the value of the run time type

Since interface values can be compared with == or !=, they can be the key of a [[id:20548195-5c08-41a1-9342-f11f5fd54dee][Go Map]]
two interface values are equal if their type descriptor and value is equal
CAVEAT: not all run time value are comparable, e.g. slices, maps. So it could cause panic
